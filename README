Notes on building documentation for CISM
----------------------------------------
MJH March 2014

* A number of utilities/programs need to be manually specified at the top of the Makefile.  The current values work for me on my Mac, but minor adjustments may be needed by others.

* The version number of the code needs to be manually updated by editing the file ./common/version.tex

* The external packages in 'ext' are not included in the documentation for now.  This was set by adding a new file "selected_ext.tex" with values of False set in it.  This file was supposed to be generated by autotools from selected_ext.tex.in.

* The program dia is needed to convert some diagrams in .dia format to .eps format
On a Mac, it can be obtained with:
> sudo port install dia

* The program fig2ps is needed to convert some diagrams in .fig format to .eps format
On a Mac, it can be obtained with:
> sudo port install fig2ps
