\section{Higher-Order Test Cases}
\label{sc:ho-tests}

The higher-order test cases are designed to test various aspects of higher-order dycores.
By default they use the Glissade dycore with the Blatter-Pattyn approximation 
(see Section~\ref{sc:glissade-blatter-pattyn}.
As other higher-order dycores become available, they can be applied
to these same tests. Additional test cases will be added as needed.

% =====================================
\subsection{Dome}
% =====================================
The dome test case is based on a parabolic dome of ice, similar to the Halfar test case.
By default the dome has the same radius and center thickness as the Halfar case.
However, it uses a simple square root function to define thickness as a function 
of distance from the dome center, resulting in a somewhat steeper profile.  
The dome test has been widely used for day-to-day testing
because it is simple and relatively fast to run.  It is a good test
to confirm that basic higher-order model physics is working correctly, but does
not strenuously test the physics and boundary conditions, or analytically verify the model.

%\textit{Optional: Time-dependent forcing example} \\

\par
The dome test case can be used to set up an example of CISM's time-dependent
forcing capability.  (See Section \ref{io-config} for details.)
To create a forcing file with some time-varying (though arbitrary) forcing, run:

\texttt{./dome.forcing.py}\\

\noindent
Then you can run the model using the \texttt{dome.forcing.config} configuration file:

\texttt{./dome.py -c dome.forcing.config}\\

\noindent
or

\texttt{./cism\_driver dome.forcing.config}\\

\subsubsection{Results}
There is not an analytic solution for this test, nor is there a script to analyze
the results.  You can manually inspect the results using a tool such as \texttt{ncview}.\footnote{See section \ref{sec:install-netcdf}}
Sample output is shown in Figure \ref{fig:domeresults}.

\subsection{ISMIP-HOM}
% =====================================
The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Higher-Order Models (ISMIP-HOM)
prescribes a set of experiments for testing the implementation of higher-order physics.  
For more information, see \href{http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/ismip/}{here}
\footnote{http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/ismip/} and the ISMIP-HOM description paper by \citet{Pattyn2008}.

The python scripts provided (runISMIPHOM.py and plotISMIPHOM.py, referred to here as the ISMIP-HOM 
scripts) were created to run experiments A through F using CISM and compare the results with results from other models. 

Note: The \texttt{README} file gives many additional details about running and analyzing the
test case that are not described here.

\subsubsection{Provided files}

\begin{itemize}
	\item README \\
		Information about the test case, including technical details about running it.
	\item ishom.config \\
		A default configuration file used as a template for generating the .config file for each test.
    		If you wish to run the tests with different solver settings, for example, you should edit this file.
	\item runISMIPHOM.py \\
		The script used for running any/all of the ISMIP-HOM experiments.  
    		Invoke with `- - help' to see the many command line options for controlling execution.
  \item plotISMIPHOM.py \\
		The script used for analyzing/plotting any/all of the ISMIP-HOM experiments.  
    		Invoke with `- - help' to see the many command line options for controlling execution.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Running the test}
One script sets up the initial condition and runs the model:

\texttt{./runISMIPHOM.py}

\noindent
and another is used to analyze the results:

\texttt{./plotISMIPHOM.py}

\subsubsection{Results}
The \texttt{plotISMIPHOM.py} script will plot results relative to other models.
None of the ISMIP-HOM tests have a useful analytic solution, so these tests are
used as community benchmarks rather than actual model verification tests.
The \citet{Pattyn2008} paper is useful for intepreting model results.
An example output plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ismiphom-results}.

\begin{figure}[H!]

	\includegraphics[width=10.0cm]{\dir/ISMIP-HOM-A-cis1.eps}
	\caption{An example of the ISMIP-HOM test case output for test A at size L=160 km. 
CISM output is shown with a black line, and the range of output from other models is shown by colored bars. 
This figure was generated with \texttt{./plotISMIPHOM.py -e a -s 160} after running the test with \texttt{./runISMIPHOM.py -e a -s 160}.
Additional options (e.g., running and plotting for multiple tests simultaneously) are described in the \texttt{README} and by invoking the
`- - help' option at the command line.}

\subsection{Stream}
% =====================================
\label{sc:stream_test}
The stream test case simulates flow over an idealized ice stream underlain by a subglacial till with a known and specified
yield stress distribution (see discussion in Section \ref{sc:higher-order-bcs}). For the two yield stress distributions specified in this test case, 
analytical solutions are available from \citet{Raymond2000} and \citet{Schoof2006}. 

For the Raymond test case, the yield stress within the ice stream is given a uniform value below the driving stress, and outside the
ice stream it is given a uniform value much higher than the driving stress (i.e., the yield stress distribution is approximated by a
step function). For the Schoof test case, the till yield stress across the ice stream is given by a continuously varying function.

In both cases, the basal properties vary in the across-flow direction only and are symmetric about the ice stream centerline.
As a result, the velocity solutions are also uniform along flow and symmetric about the centerline.

\subsubsection{Provided files}

\begin{itemize}
	\item README \\
		Information about the test case, including technical details about running it.
	\item runStream.py \\
		The script to set up and run the test test.
	\item stream.config.in \\
  The default configuration settings for running CISM with the test case. Note that this
  file is parsed by the runStream.py script. Most of the relevant options that might be changed
  for this test case (e.g., grid spacing) can be done so from the command line, without having to
  edit the .config files (use \texttt{./runStream.py --help} for a description of available options).
  The choice of yield stress distribution (Raymond or Schoof) can be toggled
  by editing line 15 of \texttt{runStream.py}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Running the test}
One script sets up the initial condition and runs the model:

\texttt{./runStream.py}

\noindent
and another is used to analyze the results:

\texttt{./plotStream.py}

\subsubsection{Results}
The \texttt{plotStream.py} script will plot model output relative to the analytical solutions
in \citet{Raymond2000} and \citet{Schoof2006}. The choice of analytical solution for comparison
is automatic, based on the yield stress chosen in the runStream.py script. 
Figure \ref{fig:stream-results} shows example output for both test cases.

Note: The excellent agreement between the CISM results and the Raymond analytical solution
requires setting \texttt{which\_ho\_assemble\_beta = 1} in the config file
(see Section~\ref{ug.sec.config}). With this setting, the step change in yield
stress is well resolved. Otherwise there is some smoothing of the traction 
parameter $\beta$ over neighboring nodes during finite-element assembly
(Section~\ref{sec:glissade-assembly}), and the results are less accurate.

\subsection{Confined shelf}
% =====================================
The confined shelf test is based on tests 3 and 4 of the idealized (i.e., not Ross) EISMINT shelf test 
cases.  It simulates the flow within an idealized, 500 m thick ice shelf in a 
confined, rectangular embayment.  Grounded ice is not explicitly modeled but included in the 
model setup as Dirichlet boundary conditions for velocity along the ice shelf edges.
More detailed information on this test case can be found 
\href{http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/iceshelf.html}{here}
\footnote{http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/iceshelf.html} in the 
``shelf-descr.pdf" document.

Note that the confined shelf and circular shelf experiments are both in the 
\texttt{tests/higher-order/shelf} directory and share some files.

\subsubsection{Provided files}

\begin{itemize}
	\item README \\
		Information about the test case, including technical details about running it.
	\item confined-shelf.py \\

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Running the test}
One script sets up the initial condition and runs the model:

\texttt{./confined-shelf.py}

\subsubsection{Results}
There is no script for analyzing the results.  See the URL above for information 
about assessing the model output.
You can manually inspect the results using a tool such as \texttt{ncview}.
Figure \ref{fig:confinedshelf-results} shows an example.

% =====================================
\subsection{Circular shelf}
% =====================================
The circular shelf test case is a variant on the confined shelf discussed above. It simulates the flow within a circular ice shelf with a uniform thickness
of 1000 m, which is grounded at a single grid point at its center. This test case confirms a working ``floating ice" boundary condition
in 2D (i.e, in map plane view) and also confirms radial symmetry. 

Note that the confined shelf and circular shelf experiments are both in the 
\texttt{tests/higher-order/shelf} directory and share some files.

\begin{itemize}
	\item README \\
		Information about the test case, including technical details about running it.
	\item circular-shelf.py \\
		The script to set up and run the test test.
	\item circular-shelf.config \\
          The default configuration settings for running CISM with the test case.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Running the test}
One script sets up the initial condition and runs the model:

\texttt{./circular-shelf.py}

\subsubsection{Results}
There is no  script for analyzing the results.

% =====================================
\subsection{Ross Ice Shelf}
\label{sc:ross_test}
% =====================================
The Ross experiment is designed to simulate the flow of the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica under idealized conditions (e.g., constant and uniform
flow-law rate factor). For more information about the experiment and its results, see 
\href{http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/iceshelf.html}{here}\footnote{http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/iceshelf.html}. 
Also, see \citet{MacAyeal:1996vn} for a discussion of the official model intercomparison results.

Using the Glissade solver with the Blatter-Pattyn approximation, this experiment typically 
takes about 10 minutes to run on a single processor.  Using the shallow-shelf approximation instead,
the results are very similar and are found more quickly (in less than a minute).
For this reason, the SSA (\texttt{which\_ho\_approx = 1}) is the default.

\subsubsection{Provided files}

\begin{itemize}
	\item README \\
		Information about the test case, including technical details about running it.
	\item runRoss.py \\
		The script to set up and run the test test.
	\item ross.config \\
  The default configuration settings for running CISM with the test case.
	\item plotRoss.py \\
		The script to plot the test results.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Running the test}
One script sets up the initial condition and runs the model:

\texttt{./runRoss.py -r}

\noindent
(Without the ``-r'' flag, the script will set up the initial condition but not run CISM.)
Another script can be used to visualize the results:

\texttt{./plotRoss.py}

\subsubsection{Results}
The \texttt{plotRoss.py} script will generate a figure of the velocity field
calculated for the Ross Ice Shelf.  The results should look very similar to Figures \ref{fig:rossresults1} and \ref{fig:rossresults2}. You can
compare these with similar figures in the paper by \citet{MacAyeal:1996vn}.
