\section{GLIDE}
GLIDE is the actual ice sheet model. GLIDE comprises three procedures which initialise the model, perform a single time step and finalise the model. The GLIDE configuration file is described in Section \ref{ug.sec.config}. The GLIDE API is described in Appendix \ref{ug.sec.glide_api}. The simple example driver explains how to write a simple climate driver for GLIDE. Download the example from the GLIMMER website or from CVS:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@forge.nesc.ac.uk:/cvsroot/glimmer co glimmer-example
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configuration}\label{ug.sec.config}
The format of the configuration files is taken from that used by the ConfigParser module in Python 2.x, which is similar to Windows \texttt{.ini} files and contains sections. Each section contains key, value(s) pairs.
\begin{itemize}
\item Empty lines, or lines starting with a \texttt{\#}, \texttt{;} or \texttt{!} are ignored.
\item A new section starts with the the section name enclose with square brackets, e.g. \texttt{[grid]}.
\item Keys are separated from their associated values by a \texttt{=} or \texttt{:}.
\end{itemize}
Sections and keys are case sensitive and may contain white space. However, the configuration parser is very simple and thus the number of spaces within a key or section name also matters. Sensible defaults are used when a specific key is not found.  Defaults are indicated in bold in the table below.

For consistency, options for both the shallow-ice and higher-order dynamical cores (dycore) are discussed. {\bf TODO: Keep this statement?} Currently, only the shallow ice dycore is scientifically supported. The higher-order dycore will be supported as part of planned future releases of Glimmer CISM. {\bf TODO: Keep this convention?} Configuration number options with a * after them are specific to the higher-order dycore.

NetCDF I/O can be configured in the main configuration file or in a separate file 
(see \texttt{ioparams} in the \texttt{[options]} section). 
Any number of input, forcing, and output files can be specified. 

Input files are processed in the same order they occur in the configuration file, 
thus potentially overwriting previously loaded fields.  The configuration section 
for an input file specified which time slice from the input file should be used as
the initial condition.  (Note this is an integer specifying the time level, not
the actual time.)

Forcing files are new in CISM 2.0 and are input files that are read on every 
time step to allow time-dependent
forcing to be applied during a simulation.  Any inputtable fields can be included
in forcing files.  Forcing files should have a ``time'' field which is used to 
assign values to each field in the file during the simulation.  Forcing is applied 
in a piecewise constant fashion -- the most recent time slice in the forcing file prior
to the current model time is used on each time step.  (Linearly interpolatation of
forcing may be available in the future but is not currently implemented.)
Note that if a field is present in both an input file and in a
forcing file at the start time, the value in the forcing file will overwrite the value
from the input file because forcing files get read after input files.
Forcing files are processed in the same order they occur in the configuration file, 
on each time step thus potentially overwriting previously loaded fields from other
forcing files.
