\section{Introduction}

Some introductory stuff here about ice sheet models; what GLIMMER-CISM is supposed to be used for; maybe some notes on major changes relative to prev. releases

\section{Overview}

Code overview here. Some notes on diff. dycores available, levels of complexity available (serial vs. parallel, native solvers vs. Trilinos, etc.), directory structure ... any other high level points about the code we want to make. I'm imagining this section to be a page or two, maybe to include a slightly more detailed discussion on what the rest of the document contains (slightly more detailed than the table of contents that is).
