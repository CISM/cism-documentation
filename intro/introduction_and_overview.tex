%
GLIMMER-CISM\footnote{{\it GLIMMER} was originally an acronym, reflecting the project's origin within the GENIE climate model. The meaning of the GLIMMER acronym is no longer important, however. CISM stands for Community Ice Sheet Model ... more of this sort of info here?} is a numerical model - a collection of software libraries, utilities and drivers  - used to simulate ice sheet evolution. It has two different "dynamical cores", which solve the equations for the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. The serial, shallow-ice representation for ice dynamics from the original GLIMMER model is still supported through the GLIDE dynamical core \textbf{SP: pointer to correct chapter here}. GLIMMER-CISM2 also supports higher-order ice dynamics, scalable parallelism, and links to robust third-party solver libraries through the new GLISSADE dynamical core \textbf{SP: pointer to correct chapter here}. GLIMMER-CISM2 is modular in design and coded almost entirely in standards-complient Fortran 95 \textbf{SP:should this be F90?}. New with GLIMMER-CISM2 is the introduction of software hooks to allow for coupling to modern, well maintained, C++ based solver libraries. \textbf{more?}

\section{Overview}
%
GLIMMER-CISM2 consists of several components:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf GLIDE:} {\bf G}eneral {\bf L}and {\bf I}ce {\bf D}ynamic {\bf E}lements: the dynamical core for the model based on shallow-ice dynamics. This component is responsible for solving the governing conservation equations and determining ice velocities, internal ice temperature distribution, and ice geometry evolution. In addition, GLIDE components determine isostatic adjustment and meltwater production. GLIDE needs some representation of the climate to run, provided by a {\it driver} program. The user may write their own driver code, or may use one of the four supplied drivers (see section \ref{subsec:climdrive} below).
\item {\bf GLISSADE:} {\bf acronymn for this?}: the dynamical core for the higher-order model based on the 1st-order accurate Stokes approximation. As with GLIDE, this component is responsible for solving the governing conservation equations. Unlike GLIDE, the GLISSADE dynamical core is fully parallel to take advantage of modern, multi-processor, high-performance architectures.

\item {\bf needs updating below here ...}
\item {\bf SIMPLE:} Simple climate drivers that implement the experiments of the first phase of the EISMINT project, with idealised geometry. 
\item {\bf GLINT:} {\bf GL}IMMER {\bf Int}erface. Originally developed for the GENIE\footnote{Grid-ENabled Integrated Earth-system model} Earth Systems Model, GLINT allows the core ice model to be coupled to a variety of global climate models, or indeed any source of time-varying climate data on a lat-long grid. An example driver is provided to illustrate the use of GLINT, which uses temperature and precipitation data to drive a positive degree day (PDD) mass-balance model.
\item {\bf EIS:} {\bf E}dinburgh {\bf I}ce {\bf S}heet climate driver based on a parameterisation of the equilibrium line altitude, sea-level surface temperatures and eustatic sea-level change.
\item {\bf EISMINT3:} An implementation of a later part of the EISMINT project, concerning the modelling of the Greenland ice sheet.
\item {\bf GLUM:} {\bf G}Limmer {\bf U}seful {\bf M}odules, various utility procedures used by the other components.
\item Visualisation programs using GMT\footnote{Generic Mapping Tools}.

\subsection{Climate Drivers}
\label{subsec:climdrive}
The core ice sheet model, GLIDE, is connected to the climate via the surface mass balance and temperature fields and (optionally) a scalar value for eustatic sea level. These drivers can be derived from simple assumptions, e.g. uniform mass balance or EISMINT tests, or from climate model output, e.g. GENIE or a regional climate model. These components, and how they relate to each other, are outlined in Figure \ref{ug.glide}.

\subsection{Configuration, I/O and Visualisation}
In general terms, each component is configured using a configuration file similar to Windows \texttt{.ini} files. At run-time, model configuration is printed to a log file. 

2D and 3D data is read/written to/from netCDF files using the CF (Climate-Forecast) metadata convention\footnote{\texttt{http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/}}. NetCDF is a scientific data format for storing multidimensional data in a platform- and language-independent binary format. The CF conventions specify the metadata used to describe the file contents.

Many programs can process and visualise netCDF data, e.g. OpenDX, Matlab, IDL, etc. Additionally, the GLIMMER code bundle contains GMT scripts written in Python to visualise the output.
