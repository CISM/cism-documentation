\section{Input/Output Configuration}

NetCDF I/O can be configured in the main configuration file or in a separate file 
(see \texttt{ioparams} in the \texttt{[options]} section). 
Any number of input, forcing, and output files can be specified. 

Input files are processed in the same order they occur in the configuration file, 
thus potentially overwriting previously loaded fields.  The configuration section 
for an input file specifies which time slice from the input file should be used as
the initial condition.  (Note this is an integer specifying the time level, not
the actual time.)

Forcing files are new in CISM 2.0 and are input files that are read on every 
time step to allow time-dependent
forcing to be applied during a simulation.  Any inputtable fields can be included
in forcing files.  Forcing files should have a ``time'' field which is used to 
assign values to each field in the file during the simulation.  Forcing is applied 
in a piecewise constant fashion -- the most recent time slice in the forcing file prior
to the current model time is used on each time step.  (Linearly interpolatation of
forcing may be available in the future but is not currently implemented.)
Note that if a field is present in both an input file and in a
forcing file at the start time, the value in the forcing file will overwrite the value
from the input file because forcing files get read after input files.
Forcing files are processed in the same order they occur in the configuration file, 
on each time step thus potentially overwriting previously loaded fields from other
forcing files.  The ``dome'' test case (\texttt{tests/higher-order/dome}) includes 
an example of how to use time-dependent forcing.
