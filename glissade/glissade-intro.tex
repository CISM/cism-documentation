\label{sc:glissade-intro}

CISM includes a parallel, higher-order dynamical core called Glissade\footnote
{The name ``Glissade'' was originally an acronym, but as with ``Glimmer'' and ``Glide'' the acronym is rarely used.
It can be pronounced either American--style (gliss--AID) or French--style (gliss--AHD).},
the successor to the Glide shallow-ice dycore.
Like Glide, Glissade solves equations for conservation of momentum
(i.e., an appropriate approximation of Stokes flow), mass, and internal energy. 
Glissade numerics, however, differ substantially from Glide numerics:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Velocity:}
Glide is limited to the shallow-ice approximation, whereas Glissade can solve several Stokes
approximations, as described in Section \ref{sc:glissade-velocity}.
These include a 3D first-order Blatter-Pattyn solver (the most accurate and complex scheme)
as well as simpler solvers for the shallow-ice approximation (SIA), shallow-shelf approximation (SSA),
and a vertically integrated higher-order approximation.
Unlike Glide, which computes the velocity using finite-difference techniques,
Glissade uses a more robust and flexible finite-element method.

\item \textit{Temperature:}
To evolve the ice temperature, Glide solves a prognostic equation that incorporates horizontal advection as well
as vertical heat diffusion and internal dissipation.  In Glissade, temperature advection is handled by the
transport scheme, and a separate module solves for vertical diffusion and internal dissipation.
The vertical solver, described in Section \ref{sc:glissade-temperature}, is local; 
each ice column calculation is independent of other column calculations.

\item \textit{Mass and tracer transport:}
Glide solves a diffusion equation for tranport of mass (i.e., ice thickness); this equation incorporates the local shallow-ice
velocities. Since Glissade solves for higher-order flow that may have a large advective (as oppposed to diffusive)
component, a different approach is needed.  Glissade has two mass- and energy-conserving transport options, 
described in Section \ref{sc:glissade-transport}:
incremental remapping (the more complex and accurate scheme) and first-order upwind. These schemes
transport mass and internal energy in the horizontal direction, followed by a vertical remapping to
sigma coordinates.

\end{itemize}

Glissade numerics are described in detail below.


%Some introductory text that might be useful here, but that was out of place in a previous section 
%(taken from the end of ./modeling-intro/modeling-intro.tex), has been pasted into the respective .tex file
%for this section (./glissade/glissade-intro.tex) but is commented out for now.


%3D, thermo-mechanically coupled ice sheet models. 3D refers to the
%explicit vertical layering of the model for computing temperature.
%Thermo-mechanical means that the ice viscosity is sensitive to
%temperature, and an iterative procedure must be used to find the flow
%rates from temperature. Both models exploit the often used shallow ice
%approximation \textbackslash{}citep\{hutter83\}, which accounts for the
%membrane like nature of ice sheets by reducing the stress tensor to only
%leading order terms resulting from simple shear. The shallow ice
%approximation, when combined with the non-linear constituative relation
%given by Glen's flow law \textbackslash{}citep\{paterson94\}, leads to
%the following expression for horizontal velocities
%
%$\begin{matrix}
%u_i(z) &=& -2 (\rho g)^n \vert \nabla s\vert ^{n-1} \frac{\partial s}{\partial i} 
%\int_h^z A(\theta^*)(s-z)^n dz + u_i(h)\\
%i &=& x,y.
%\end{matrix}$
%
%All parameters and symbols used in this paper appear in table
%\textbackslash{}ref\{symbols\}. It is worth noting that all quantities
%used to find the horizontal velocities are computed locally. The shallow
%ice approximation eliminates terms resulting from transverse or lateral
%stresses. The temperature sensitivity of ice flow is given by an
%Arrhenius relation,
%
%$
%A(\theta^*) = a \exp \left(\frac{-Q}{R\theta^*}\right).
%$
%
%Which, in typical ice temperature ranges (-50 -{}- 0 C$^\circ$) varies
%over 3 orders of magnitude. However because most shear occurs at the
%base, and the base is warmed by dissipation and geothermal heat flow, a
%more appropriate range is -20 -{}- 0 C$^\circ$. This gives a range of
%$A$ over about a factor of 30.
%
%Assuming that horizontal diffusion is negligible, again due to the
%membrane nature or very small aspect ratio (ratio of vertical to lateral
%extent) of ice sheets, the ice temperature field is found from the
%conservation of energy
%
%$ 
%\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho c}
%\frac{\partial^2
%\theta}{\partial z^2} -
%\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \theta -
%u_z \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z} 
%+ \frac{g(s-z)}{c}\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial z} \cdot \nabla s.
%$
%
%The terms on the right hand side from left to right are vertical
%diffusion, horizontal advection, vertical advection, and dissipation
%(using only the shallow ice stress tensor). Equation
%\textbackslash{}ref\{temp\} is subject to the boundary conditions
%
%$\begin{matrix}
%\theta - \theta_s(x,y) = & 0 &~\forall z=s \\
%k \nabla \theta \cdot \mathbf{\hat n}(h) =& -G(x,y) + \mathbf{u} \cdot \tau_d
%&~\forall z=h.
%\end{matrix}$
%
%The upper surface is set to a mean annual temperature ($\theta_s$), and
%the lower surface is accounting for the heat sources from both
%geothermal heat ($G$) flux, and frictional heat generated when ice
%slides over the bed. The temperatures are constrained by the melting
%point corrected for pressure via the Clausius-{}-Clapeyron gradient
%
%$
%\theta^* = \theta - \beta (s-z)
%$
%
%The vertical advection term in equation \textbackslash{}ref\{temp\}
%requires vertical velocities. They are found from incompressibility,
%
%$
%\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + 
%\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} +
%\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} = 0,
%$
%
%by integrating with respect to $z$, giving
%
%$
%u_z(z) = -\int_h^z \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial
%u_y}{\partial y}\right ) dz + M + \mathbf{u}(h) \cdot \nabla h.
%$
%
%Were the complete accounting must include the melt rate and bed
%topography. Basal melt rates computed from the jump boundary condition
%at the bed,
%
%$
%M = \frac{1}{\rho L} \left ( k \frac{\partial
%\theta(h)}{\partial z} + G + \mathbf{u} \cdot \tau_d \right ).
%$
%
%Having solved for the temperature dependent velocity fields, changes in
%the ice sheet's geometry are computed from the continuity equation
%
%$
%\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{\bar u} H) + B - M.
%$
%
%Both models use the finite difference methods for descritization of the
%partial differential equations. GLIMMER differs from PISM in that it
%offers a choice of implicit schemes for solving equation
%\textbackslash{}ref\{continuity\}, whereas PISM uses an explicit scheme
%\textbackslash{}citep\{press92\}. Further, GLIMMER utilizes a rescaled,
%or $\sigma$ vertical coordinate \textbackslash{}citep\{lliboutry87\} and
%PISM does not. PISM uses the PETSc
%\textbackslash{}citep\{petsc-user-ref\} library to achieve parallelism
%and has the capacity to include a more complete stress formulation, but
%that capacity was not used here. Additional discussion of the field
%equations and numerical methods used in GLIMMER can be found in
%\textbackslash{}citet\{payne97\} and \textbackslash{}citet\{payne99\}.
%
%The ice sheet model CISM uses a finite difference method to solve the
%governing thermodynamic equations for ice using the \{\textbackslash{}it
%shallow ice approximation\}. This is the approach generally adopted for
%modeling large ice masses. The assumption is made that slopes at the
%upper and lower surfaces are sufficiently small that normal stress
%components can be neglected. This leads to a \{\textbackslash{}it
%local\} balance between the gravitational driving stress and the basal
%shear stress and expressions for the shear stresses
%
%$\begin{matrix}
%\tau_{xz}(z)&=&-\rho g \left(s - z \right) \frac{\partial s}{\partial x}  \\
%\tau_{yz}(z)&=&-\rho g \left(s - z \right) \frac{\partial s}{\partial y}
%\end{matrix}$
%
%Evolution of the ice thickness uses equation
%\textbackslash{}ref\{equation:mabalfinc\} and the temperature solver
%uses a version of equation \textbackslash{}ref\{equation:enbalfin\}
%simplified to neglect horizontal diffusion (a typical simplification).
%
%The model equations are solved on a regular grid using the Glen flow law
%(equation \textbackslash{}ref\{equation:Glen\}) and appropriate boundary
%conditions for the upper and lower surfaces. These include the surface
%ice accumulation rate and temperature and a geothermal gradient (applied
%at the base of a bedrock layer with specified thermal properties). Basal
%traction may also be specified, in the situation where ice is at the
%melt temperature at the base. Isostatic adjustment of the land surface
%beneath the ice sheet, not discussed here, is also included.
%
%\subsubsection{numerical scheme}
%
%The continuous functions represented by the model governing equations
%cannot be solved exactly. Instead, they are discretized so that finite
%approximations of their solutions may be made. There are a variety of
%numerical techniques available for this purpose, GLIMMER makes use of a
%finite difference method.
%
%In brief, the model domain (a region of Earth's surface, for example,
%Greenland) is subdivided into a regularly-spaced horizontal grid and
%derivatives are approximated along the grid directions. The grid is
%fixed in space over the course of the model run. Model variables such as
%ice thickness are updated at each time step according to the numerical
%approximations of the governing equations. The vertical dimension is
%treated using a non-dimensional ``stretch'' coordinate so that an
%evolving ice thickness may be accommodated. The scaling is:
%
%$
%\zeta~=~\frac{s-z}{H}
%$
%
%so that $\zeta=1$ at the surface $s$ and $\zeta=0$ at the base. The
%governing equations must be re-written in the new, $(x, y, \zeta)$
%coordinate system.
%

%documentation is available at the class website. This is not necessary
%for the present lab exercise.
