\label{sc:glissade-temperature}

As noted in Section (insert ref here), the thermal evolution of the ice sheet is given by

\begin{equation}
  \label{gliss.eq.temperature_evol}
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 
  \frac{k}{\rho c} {{\nabla }^{2}}T - \bf{u}\cdot \nabla T - w\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} + \frac{\Phi }{\rho c}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $T$ is the temperature, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of ice, $c$ is the specific heat of ice,
and $\Phi$ is the rate of heating due to internal deformation and dissipation.
This equation describes the conservation of internal energy under horizontal and vertical 
diffusion (the first term), advection (the second and third terms), and dissipation
(the last term).
Glide solves this equation in module {\tt glide\_temperature.F90}.
Glissade takes a different approach, dividing the temperature evolution into an advective term
and a diffusion/dissipation term.
Module {\tt glissade\_temperature.F90} solves for diffusion and internal dissipation:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho c}{{\nabla }^{2}}T + \frac{\Phi }{\rho c},
\end{equation}

\noindent
as described in this section.
The advective part of \eqref{gliss.eq.temperature_evol} is described separately
in Section \ref{sc:glissade-transport}.
