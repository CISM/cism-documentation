\label{ch:glide}

This chapter describes the numerical implementation of mass, momentum, and energy conservation in the Glide dynamical core. For a model governed by shallow-ice dynamics, the solutions for the conservation of mass and momentum are intimately linked.

\section{Time Step Ordering}

Relative to Glimmer-CISM 1.x, the order of operations on each time step has been
somewhat reorganized in CISM2.0.  This was done for consistency with the ordering
of operations used in Glissade and to eliminate discrepancies between time levels
applied in the model and the time levels written in output files.  
\textbf{These changes have only a minor impact on model results, but do result 
in output that will not be an exact match between the two model versions for the
same configuration and initial conditions.}

While unlikely to be of much interest to the average user, particularly if you are not
migrating from Glimmer-CISM 1.x, the details of these changes follow.
Specifically, in Glimmer-CISM 1.x, for a given time step, $H$ is advanced in time
relative to $T$ and $\vec{v}$, and, because a complete solve occurs even at the 
initial time, the output for the initial time is different than the input for 
the prognostic variables $H$ and $T$, even though no time step has occurred at 
that point.

In Glimmer-CISM 1.x, the time-stepping loop is organized as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
glide_initialise(): init T, H, v
do while (t < tend)
   glide_tstep_p1(): solve T
   glide_tstep_p2(): solve v, H
   glide_tstep_p3(): calculate some diagnostic variables, write output for time t
   advance time
end do
\end{verbatim}

\noindent This results in the following relation between the state of model variables and
the time level at which they are output:

%\begin{table}[h]
%\caption{Relation between state of model variables and output time level in Glimmer-CISM 1.x}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Output time:  & 0    & 1   & 2  \\
\hline
$T$  &  1                    &  2                    &  3  \\
$H$  &  1                    &  2                    &  3  \\
$v$  &  0                    &  1                    &  2  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
%\end{table}
\\~\\  % hack to get a little more vertical separation here

In CISM 2.0, the time-stepping loop is now organized as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
initialize modules
initial diagnostic solve of v (and any other diagnostic variables like upper surface)
write output for time 0
do while (t <= tend)
   advance time
   solve column physics: T = f(H,T) 
   solve prognostic variables: advection of H=f(H,v), T=f(H,v)
   solve diagnostic variables: v=f(H,T)
   write output for time t
end do
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
This results in the following relation between the state of model variables and
the time level at which they are output:

%\begin{table}[h]
%\caption{Relation between state of model variables and output time level in CISM 2.0}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Output time:  & 0    & 1   & 2  \\
\hline
$T$  &  0                    &  1                    &  2  \\
$H$  &  0                    &  1                    &  2  \\
$v$  &  0                    &  1                    &  2  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
